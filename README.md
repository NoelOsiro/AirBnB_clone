## Solution Structure üìÇ
- üìÅ `models`: Contains all classes used in the solution, representing objects/instances.
- üìÅ `tests`: Houses all unit tests.
- üìÑ `console.py`: The entry point for the command interpreter.
- üìÑ `models/base_model.py`: The base class for all models, with common elements like attributes `id`, `created_at`, and `updated_at`, and methods `save()` and `to_json()`.
- üìÅ `models/engine`: Stores storage classes, initially just `file_storage.py`.

## Storage Solution üíæ
Persistence is key for web applications, ensuring data continuity between program executions. Our solution covers two types of storage: file and database, with the initial focus on file storage.

Why separate "storage management" from "model"? This architecture promotes modularity and independence, facilitating the swapping of storage systems without extensive code modification.

## Class Attributes üßæ
We emphasize using class attributes for objects, rather than instance attributes, for several reasons:
1. Provides clear class descriptions.
2. Offers default attribute values.
3. Ensures consistent model behavior for both file and database storage in the future.

## File Storage and JSON Serialization

In this section, we'll delve into the critical aspect of file storage and JSON serialization. This process involves saving your objects/instances to a file when created or updated in the command interpreter and restoring them when the interpreter is started again.

### Saving Objects to a File

To save Python objects to a file, follow these steps:

1. **Convert to Serializable Data Structure**: Use the method `my_instance.to_json()` to convert an instance into a Python built-in serializable data structure, typically a dictionary.

2. **Serialize to JSON Format**: Convert this data structure to a string in JSON format (though other formats like YAML or XML can be used). For our purposes, this can be achieved with `my_string = JSON.dumps(my_dict)`.

3. **Write to Disk**: Write this string to a file on disk, which serves as your storage medium.

### Restoring Objects from a File

Restoring objects from a file involves the reverse process:

1. **Read from Disk**: Read a string from a file on disk. This string represents the serialized data, typically in JSON format.

2. **Deserialize to Data Structure**: Convert this string to a data structure. Since it's in JSON format, you can easily achieve this with `my_dict = JSON.loads(my_string)`.

3. **Convert to Instance**: Finally, convert this data structure back into an instance of the relevant class using `my_instance = MyObject(my_dict)`.

## *args and **kwargs

In programming, `*args` and `**kwargs` are special constructs used to pass a variable number of arguments to functions or methods. They are widely used in Python and play an essential role in flexible and dynamic code.

### *args (Positional Arguments)

- `*args` allows you to pass a variable number of non-keyword (positional) arguments to a function or method.
- These arguments are collected into a tuple, which can be iterated over or processed as needed within the function.
- This flexibility enables you to call functions with different numbers of arguments.

### **kwargs (Keyword Arguments)




## Setup and Installation

### Description of the Command Interpreter
The project includes a command interpreter (Console) that provides the following functionalities:
- Create a data model.
- Manage objects through a console/command interpreter.
- Store and persist objects to a JSON file.

### How to Start It
To start the AirBnB Clone Solution, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project's root directory.
3. Run the `console.py` script.

### How to Use It
Once the command interpreter is running, you can use it to perform various operations, including creating and managing objects. Here are some basic commands to get you started:
- `create <class_name>`: Create an instance of the specified class.
- `show <class_name> <object_id>`: Show details of a specific object.
- `all <class_name>`: List all objects of a specific class.
- `update <class_name> <object_id> <attribute_name> "<new_value>"`: Update an attribute of an object.

### Code Examples
Here are some code examples to demonstrate how to use the command interpreter:
```bash
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) create User
3fb9d628-6b95-4bdf-91e4-19b2f4341eb9
(hbnb) show User 3fb9d628-6b95-4bdf-91e4-19b2f4341eb9
[User] (3fb9d628-6b95-4bdf-91e4-19b2f4341eb9) {'id': '3fb9d628-6b95-4bdf-91e4-19b2f4341eb9', 'created_at': datetime.datetime(2023, 10, 10, 12, 0, 0), 'updated_at': datetime.datetime(2023, 10, 10, 12, 0, 0)}
(hbnb) all User
["[User] (3fb9d628-6b95-4bdf-91e4-19b2f4341eb9) {'id': '3fb9d628-6b95-4bdf-91e4-19b2f4341eb9', 'created_at': datetime.datetime(2023, 10, 10, 12, 0, 0), 'updated_at': datetime.datetime(2023, 10, 10, 12, 0, 0)}"]
(hbnb) update User 3fb9d628-6b95-4bdf-91e4-19b2f4341eb9 first_name "John"
(hbnb) show User 3fb9d628-6b95-4bdf-91e4-19b2f4341eb9
[User] (3fb9d628-6b95-4bdf-91e4-19b2f4341eb9) {'id': '3fb9d628-6b95-4bdf-91e4-19b2f4341eb9', 'created_at': datetime.datetime(2023, 10, 10, 12, 0, 0), 'updated_at': datetime.datetime(2023, 10, 10, 12, 1, 0), 'first_name': 'John'}
```
